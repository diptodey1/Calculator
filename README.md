This Python code implements a simple calculator.

Functionality:

Defines a function cal(a, b, ch) that performs arithmetic operations based on the given operator ch.
Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%), and floor division (//).
Takes two numerical inputs (floats) for operands a and b, and an operator character ch as input.
Calls the cal function to perform the specified operation and stores the result in ans.
Prints the calculation result in the format 'a' operator 'b' = 'result'.
Handles invalid operators by printing an error message.
Key points:

Uses if-elif statements to handle different operators.
Employs f-strings for formatted output.
Converts input values to floats for handling decimal numbers.
Provides basic error handling for invalid operators.
